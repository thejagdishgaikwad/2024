Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum 
Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC 
programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception 
handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[12] Its 
implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole 
responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when
he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's
"benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed
upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief
decision-maker[44] (he has since come out of retirement and is self-titled
"BDFL-emeritus"). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a
five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
